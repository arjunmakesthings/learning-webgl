### a list of online resources that i used, and found helpful during this time:

- [a good introduction to what a shader is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mfvZ-mdtZQ), in the first few minutes of this youtube video. 

- [spaces of webgl (such as pixel, uv, et-cetera (and their coordinate systems))](https://medium.com/@Zadvorsky/into-vertex-shaders-part-1-the-spaces-of-webgl-c70ded527841)
