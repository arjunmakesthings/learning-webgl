# context:
in my work with slow-studio, trying to [simulate the blotting of ink](https://github.com/slow-studio/25-inkblot) on different surfaces, we hit the limits of cpu-based (linear) processing. this became an opportune time for me to learn webgl and attempt to write a shader that blots ink the way we want to, and do so quickly on different devices. 

this repository contains notes, sketches and experiments as i wade my way through the complex world of webgl-shaders.
